        <br><br>

        1) Closed Tags: These tags must be closed by using a closing tag. 
        <br>
        Example: paragraph tag 'p' used in the code .
        <br><br>

        2) Unclosed (Self-Closing) Tags: These tags don’t need a closing tag.
        <br>
        Example: break tag adds a line break.<br><br>
