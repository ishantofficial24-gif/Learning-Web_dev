<!-- Adding images in our web page is easy just read below-->
    
    <img src="sources/lion.jpg" 
    alt="Image of a lion"
    height="200">
    <p>
        The src mean source in this we have to write the location/link of the image or gif. <br>
        And the alt means alternate in this. if our picture isn't visible by any chance then the text appears .<br>
        We can also control its height . can also do in css part.

<!-- we can also make the images as hyperlinks = Just we have to do is surround the img with <a> </a> tag -->

<!-------------------------------------------------AUDIO-------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2>funny car horn </h2>
    <audio src="sources/sound1.mp3" controls>
    </audio>
    <p>
        By writing the src we added the sound but still we need to add the controls so we added the controls
    </p>

    <audio src="sources/sound2.mp3" controls>
